## 🔬 Technical Description

### Background Art
Traditional optimization methods rely on random search (Monte Carlo) or evolutionary algorithms that search for optimal solutions through random exploration. These methods face limitations in computational efficiency and effectiveness, particularly for complex, multi-modal problems.

### Detailed Description
The strategic elimination algorithm represents a paradigm shift from searching for right answers to eliminating wrong answers. The method comprises:

**Step 1: Population Initialization**
- Generate initial population of N random solutions
- Evaluate fitness of each solution
- Sort solutions by fitness performance

**Step 2: Strategic Elimination**
- Eliminate bottom α% of solutions (typically 35%)
- Free computational resources for better solutions
- Maintain population diversity through selective pressure

**Step 3: Paradox Retention**
- Select β% of eliminated solutions (typically 15%)
- Preserve counterintuitive solutions with breakthrough potential
- Maintain diversity for unexpected discoveries

**Step 4: Population Regeneration**
- Generate new solutions through genetic operators
- Apply crossover and mutation operations
- Maintain constant population size

**Step 5: Iterative Optimization**
- Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence
- Monitor improvement metrics
- Terminate based on convergence criteria
